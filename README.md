# LeetCode Signup Page 

This is a **practice project** where I recreated a simple signup page inspired by **LeetCode**, using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The goal of this project is to strengthen my frontend fundamentals while building clean and responsive layouts.

## Project Structure
- **index.html** â€” Main signup page  
- **signin.html** â€” Sign-in page (extension)  
- **style.css** â€” Stylesheet for design and layout  
- **Leetcode.png** â€” Logo / image asset

## Note
